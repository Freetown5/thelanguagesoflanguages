            <p>
              Variables <br />
              Arrays <br />
              Methods, Functions <br />
              Loops <br />
            </p>
            <p><em>Tools in every language that let humans communicate with computers.</em></p>
            <aside class="notes">
              Computers need cold, hard facts and simple, unnuanced instructions: languages provide you with tools to create logic for computers including ways to store data, get data once you've stored it, manipulate data, and serve it all up to a user.

            <h2>What makes one language different from another?</h2>
            <p>
              <ul>
                <li>Syntax</li>
                <li>Usage</li>
                <li>Difficulty</li>

            </p>
            <p><em>What you want to build dictates what tools you should use.</em></p>
            <aside class="notes">
              Every language is different and better suited for some things over others. Lots of programmers know a handful of languages and will choose the language best suited to solve the problem at hand. Languages will differ from one another based on what the code you're writing looks like (called <em>Syntax</em>), when it's best to use it, and just how difficult the language is. Some languages are very difficult but what you can accomplish with them is worth the pain of having to learn a harder language.

            <h2>Where are HTML and CSS?</h2>
            <p>
              Not programming languages<br />
              Markup<br />
              <em>Small pieces in a very, very big puzzle</em>
            </p>
            <aside class="notes">
              Some of you want to learn HTML and CSS. These are not programming languages, they're something known as <em>markup</em>. Markup is a way of tagging information so that you can manipulate with a programming language. HTML and CSS are incredibly easy t learn but won't take you very far: you can build a simple web page with HTML and CSS but you can't build a web app people can log into. If learning HTML and CSS are your main goals, we can point you in the direction of some other groups that will help you learn these.

          <aside class="notes">
            The good news about coding is that lots of developers contribute to <em>open-source</em> - meaning that they release code they've written to make it easier to build apps. These are known as <em>frameworks</em> and tons of them exist and are always language-specific. You have probably heard of <em>Ruby on Rails</em>, which helps people build web apps using Ruby. There's also <em>Angular</em>, which helps people build web apps with Javascript. Part of building an app means researching tools and deciding whether or not you think they'll help you or make your life more difficult.

        <h2>Frontend vs Backend</h2>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>What the user interacts with</li>
            <li>Where you store your application logic</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <aside class="notes">
          In its simpliest terms, <em>frontend</em> refers to what your users interact with. If you're building a web app, this would be what you'd see at a URL and all the code that goes into making the page visible and attractive and for it to work. The <em>backend</em> refers to where you keep the nitty-gritty logic that users don't see which supports the frontend.

A website or a web app can be accessed on the internet with a URL. A webapp might do similar things to an app on your phone, meaning users can log in and save data. You might build a library, which would be tiny packets of code that other poeple find useful and can use in their own projects. You might build a framework, which can help other people build their own applications. You might build a computer program that others can download onto their computers. The sky's the limit if you have an idea and a willingness to learn.

            <em>Text editor, IDE,</em> and <em>environment</em> are words you're going to hear a lot. These are the tools that help us code. <em>Editors</em> and <em>IDEs</em> are programs that you stype code into and use to see your code in action, know as <em>running</em> or <em>building</em> your code. The tools you use to code make up what is known as your <em>dev environment</em> or your <em>development environment</em> and what makes up that environment will change based on what you're building and will change as you form your own opinions about what helps you get the job done fastest. Developers tend to be very opinionated about the tools they use, just like you're probably opinionated about where you keep things in your house: you do things a particular way so you can get your work done quickly.
