The Language of Languages
======================

The slides from the original presentation can be found [here](http://womenwhocodedc.github.io/thelanguagesoflanguages/).

# Viewing/Editing These Slides Locally
These slides use both [Node]() and [Grunt](). If you don't have these, check their websites for installation instructions. To run a web server locally to view the slides, do the following:
Ensure you have node installed:

    node -v
    v0.10.26

Then install dependencies:

    npm install

Start up your local web server:

    grunt serve
    
# Tasks 
For next presentation, some improvements that would be good in the slides:
- [ ] Add content management systems
- [ ] Idea of hack vs hack (malicious _vs_ getting something up and running fast)
- [ ] Discuss client-side _vs_ server-side: talking to people? talking to data?
- [ ] Better description of javascript: why is it unique? why is it (normally) only used on the front-end? etc.
- [ ] Languages/frameworks/etc. developed by women (COBOL, but is there anything more recent?)

_Additional Notes_: not using 'he' for every programmer description but also 'she'.

# Colophon
